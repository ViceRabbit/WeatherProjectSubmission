# Weather Project Assignment (#1)
A weather python assignment/challenge I've been given to create plots of random cities generated from random latitudes/longitudes. 

For Mr. Evans -
I've included a `pyproject.toml` for poetry (a library that helps install dependencies) that will automatically install all the required modules/library I used for this project. 
ALSO, if you wish to run the code, in `main.py`; line 7 ensure you replace the weather_key variable with a proper API key!
